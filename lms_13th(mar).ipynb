These aren't just any lunch containers; they're my ticket to a healthy and stress-free week  *  Each one is packed with a delicious and balanced meal: fluffy white rice, tender teriyaki chicken, vibrant roasted red peppers and carrots, and a generous helping of steamed broccoli  * It's a flavour explosion in every bite, and it's all ready to go!\n> \n> My journey with meal prepping hasn't always been this picture-perfect  * It started with chaotic Sunday afternoons spent frantically throwing together whatever I could find in the fridge, resulting in inconsistent portions and a lot of food waste  *  Sound familiar?\n> \n> But then I decided enough was enough! I started small, planning just one or two meals a week  * I found some fantastic recipes online (I'll share some links in the comments!), and I invested in some good quality storage containers – like the ones in the picture! \n> \n> The change has been incredible  *  Not only am I eating healthier and more consistently, but I’m saving money and so much time!  No more frantic lunchtime scrambles or last-minute takeout orders  *  It’s truly been a game-changer  *\n> \n> So, if you're thinking about starting your own meal prep journey, don't hesitate! Start small, plan ahead, and find recipes you genuinely enjoy  *  You'll be surprised how rewarding it is to have delicious, healthy meals ready to go all week long  *  And who knows, you might even find yourself snapping some pretty food pics too!\n"

            " This YouTube video introduces machine learning, covering its definition, applications, types, and the process of building a machine learning model.  Machine learning is defined as learning from data, a subfield of AI enabling smarter applications.  The video highlights applications in speech recognition, web search, recommendation systems, computer vision, information retrieval, and fraud detection.  Three main types of machine learning are explained: supervised (predicting known outcomes from labeled data, including classification and regression), unsupervised (exploring unlabeled data, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning (an agent learning through continuous activities and rewards/penalties).  The video outlines the steps in building a machine learning model: data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, encoding, feature selection), algorithm selection (choosing appropriate algorithms like decision trees or K-nearest neighbors), model building, and evaluation.  The presenter promises future videos with hands-on case studies and algorithm implementation.\n",
